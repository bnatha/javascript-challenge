# JavaScript Challenge

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace had come to Earth and I, as representative of `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All I did was put this information online for the world to see and then the matter was finally put to rest.

There was just one tiny problem... the collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

That's why I was hired! I wrote some code that created a table dynamically based upon a the data collection. 

I also placed a button to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages I can be trust.

The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!
